# javascript-password-generator

## Description

This assignment objective was to modify existing starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords. The password criteria is based on user input (setting the desired password length and selecting whether or not to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters/symbols). All interaction with the user will take place within the window alerts/ prompts.

Key reasons for making a this password generator:
- To display a fundamental grasp of basic JavaScript interactions and behaviors
- To create variables and call them into functions within the script
- To show my ability to combine variables into larger arrays, include/exclude variables based on user input, and write function outputs to a webpage
